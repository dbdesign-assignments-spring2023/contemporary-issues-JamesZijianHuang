# Contemporary Issues In Data



# Meta is accused of prioritizing “profit over the well-being of children and all users” when it came to creating manipulative algorithms that tap behavioral data to persuade users into spending more time on the platform.
In this document, I discuss two articles about wether users should still trust Meta's protection of users' data privacy given the company is accused of utilizing user data to make profits.  I present and discuss two opposing views on this important matter.

## Article 1
In Daniele Marinelli's [The Metaverse needs to keep an eye on privacy to avoid Meta’s mistakes](https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-metaverse-needs-to-keep-an-eye-on-privacy-to-avoid-meta-s-mistakes), he states that data privacy would be a huge worry for those who wants to join the Metaverse if we think about how digital marketing may be used to personalize ads. 

Regarding this claim, I mostly agree with the concern of abuse of user data, while I think whether or not users should trust Meta depends on its specific privacy policies.

## Article 2
Contrary to the claims made in Marinelli's piece on the issue, Access Partnership's [Does the Metaverse Provide an Opportunity for Meta to Redefine its Stance on Data Privacy?](https://accesspartnership.com/does-metaverse-provide-an-opportunity-for-meta-to-redefine-its-stance-on-data-privacy/) suggests that people should trust Meta for once, since the new business model of Meta is not only based on user data.

Although it is true that user data is not the only component of the company's business model, as users we should focus more on how the usage of our data by the company may affect our user experience.
